;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module rebinds `zn' key chord to `twist-edit-indirect' command.
;;
;; It differs from `helix-narrow-to-region-indirectly' (original `zn' binding)
;; which clones buffer inidrectly with narrowing in that the text properties
;; are not shared, so the parent buffer major mode and the edit-indirect buffer
;; major mode will not be able to tread on each other's toes by setting up
;; potentially conflicting text properties, which happens surprisingly often
;; when the font-lock mode is used.
;;
;; When done, exit with `edit-indirect-commit', which will remove the original
;; region and replace it with the edited version; or with `edit-indirect-abort',
;; which will drop the modifications.
;;
;; Edit-indirect buffers use the `edit-indirect-mode-map' keymap. Regions with
;; active edit-indirect buffers use the edit-indirect-overlay-map keymap.
;;
;; If there's already an edit-indirect buffer for region, use that. If there's
;; already an edit-indirect buffer active overlapping any portion of region, an
;; `edit-indirect-overlapping' error is signaled.

  "Copy region without text properties, to a separate buffer.
With \\[universal-argument] ask which major mode to use in edit-indirect buffer.

This differs from `helix-narrow-to-region-indirectly' which clones buffer
inidrectly with narrowing in that the text properties are not shared, so the
parent buffer major mode and the edit-indirect buffer major mode will not be
able to tread on each other's toes by setting up potentially conflicting text
properties, which happens surprisingly often when the font-lock mode is used.

When done, exit with `edit-indirect-commit', which will remove the original
region and replace it with the edited version; or with `edit-indirect-abort',
which will drop the modifications.

Edit-indirect buffers use the `edit-indirect-mode-map' keymap. Regions with
active edit-indirect buffers use the edit-indirect-overlay-map keymap.

If there's already an edit-indirect buffer for region, use that. If there's
already an edit-indirect buffer active overlapping any portion of region, an
`edit-indirect-overlapping' error is signaled."
